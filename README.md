### 🧠 Research Interest
My research is centered on the **innovative application of deep learning and machine learning** in:
- 🏗️ **Construction Engineering**  
- 🚦 **Traffic Management**  
- 🧩 **Construction Project Management**

With over **5 years of professional experience** in **bridge, road, and technical infrastructure construction**, I have actively contributed to projects implementing **Building Information Modeling (BIM)** across the entire lifecycle — from design to operation.

My expertise integrates:
- **BIM software:** Revit, Dynamo, Navisworks, Infraworks, BIM360  
- **3D & Simulation tools:** Unreal Engine, Omniverse, Twinmotion  
- **Programming:** Python, C#, C++, MATLAB  
- **AI frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, YOLO, OpenCV

I develop **deep learning algorithms for real-time hazard detection and object tracking** in construction and traffic environments.  
My work also involves **UAV imagery, CCTV data, and point cloud processing** to enable **early issue detection and structural integrity monitoring**.  

These methods are applied in **inspection, maintenance, and safety management**, where **BIM and Digital Twin technologies** are crucial for sustainable infrastructure.
